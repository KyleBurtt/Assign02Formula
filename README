#OverView:
This solution contains two main projects, "formula" and "formulaTests", developed as part of the CS 3500 course assignment. The goal is to implement a class that represents formulas with correct syntax validation, along with unit tests

#Projects: 
- Formula: Implements the formula class that checks the syntax of formulas
- FormulaTests: Unit tests for the formula class using the MSTest framework

#Tools Used:
- Visual Studio 2022
- C# .Net 8
- MSTest for unit testing
-Git for version control

# Setup instructions
